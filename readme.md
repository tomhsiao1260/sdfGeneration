SDF generation that can save your SDF function into [THREE.Data3DTexture](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/textures/Data3DTexture) and then render it via raymarching techniques. You can write your SDF in `GenerateSDFMaterial.js` to give it a try.

It's modified from three-mesh-bvh [example](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-mesh-bvh/blob/master/example/sdfGeneration.js).
